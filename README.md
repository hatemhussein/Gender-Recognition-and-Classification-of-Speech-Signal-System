# Gender-Recognition-and-Classification-of-Speech-Signal-System
# A gender recognition and classification system for speech signals using time and frequency domains. 
# The system involves utilizing a diverse dataset comprising at least 20 recordings for both male and female speakers, considering variations in age and environment. All recordings must feature the word "Zero" and share a common sampling frequency of 44,100 Hz. The tasks include splitting recordings into testing and training files, evaluating correlation, energy, zero-crossing count,and power spectral density. The system's accuracy is assessed by applying these techniques on different testing files.
